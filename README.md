Two Max for Live devices that automatically select one chain depending on which scene has been selected (or triggered). There is an audio and midi version so that they can be placed before audio effect racks and instrument racks. Included are racks of various sizes that are setup and ready to go.

SETUP

place an 'mm.Chain Per Scene Audio' before an 'mm.Chain' rack and then select a different scene in Ableton and see that the active chain will change depending on the scene. Simply choose from the dropdown menu which chain to be selected with the selected scene.

Do not duplicate chains, instead select all devices in a chain and paste them into the next one. This device works by moving the chain selector, so each chain needs to be active at a specific point for the chain selector.

BUTTONS

'Mute Devices' Mutes all devices except the ones on the selected chain to save CPU

'Change On Trigger' When the live set is playing, the chain will only change when a scene has been triggered, rather than as soon as it is selected

'Reset Order' Returns the device to the default mapping, where the first scene selects the first chain, second scene second chain.....
